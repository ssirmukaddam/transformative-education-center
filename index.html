    <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
    <p>My teaching is guided by principles that emphasize deep attention, questioning assumptions, and challenging false binaries in education. I strive to create spaces where teaching is not about reinforcing known truths but about exposing foundational beliefs to inquiry and transformation. Teaching safely protects the status quo; teaching with risk invites uncertainty, wonder, and the reframing of problems. I aim to uncover rather than cover curriculum, cultivating a sense of curiosity and disruption. My classes foster vibrant learning ecologies through dialogue, integration of knowledge, and shared exploration. I often lead students into “not knowing,” prompting creativity and experimentation. Recognized for my teaching with award nominations and inclusion in discussions of liberationist education, I continue to explore what that looks like in everyday teaching moments. I embrace theater and improvisation to challenge traditional classroom dynamics. Ultimately, my approach blends preparation with responsiveness, inviting joy, challenge, and transformative engagement in learning.</p>
