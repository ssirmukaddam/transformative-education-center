      <h2>Intentions of the Transformative Education Centre (TEC)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Providing a learning space for people from all walks of life.</li>
        <li>Addressing the ‘root’ (in this sense radical) of questions and challenges.</li>
        <li>Attending to everything and not taking anything for granted – reflecting unfettered and unbounded inquiry.</li>
        <li>Not meeting or answering questions or problems on their given terms but rather to question the questions themselves – reflecting paradigmatic changes.</li>
        <li>Exploring both the ‘outer world’ and the ‘world within’ and their relationship and interaction.</li>
        <li>Integrating education, inquiry, discovery, innovation, research, dialogue, and action.</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        “We did not come to keep the world as it is: we came to the world in order to remake the world.”<br>
        <strong>– Paulo Freire</strong>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        “When you change not at a superficial level but fundamentally, you affect consciousness, because you are the world and the world is you.”<br>
        <strong>– Jiddu Krishnamurti</strong>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        <strong>Outline:</strong> Transformative education situates us not as passive inheritors and recipients of our world but rather as attentive and inquiring agents of change – challenging who we are, what we are with each other, and how we live in and with this world. Rooted in experiential and liberatory learning, this transdisciplinary hub addresses educational challenges in daily life. Relinquishing settled answers and conclusions, participants leave with reframed, informed, and nuanced experiences, collaborations, struggles, insights, and enduring questions in their learning, work, and lives. The programs and activities of TEC attempt to sustain working, learning, and living with attention, exploration, passion, ingenuity, wonder, and an unquenchable thirst for learning, unlearning, and change.

      <h2>Some Problems We See With the Status Quo of Education</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Education as it exists sustains conformity and self-centeredness rather than freedom and responsibility.</li>
        <li>A fundamental structure of education at most schools/universities involves knowledge transfer from the one who ‘knows’ to the one who doesn't. When this process is repeated, the human mind and behavior are conditioned in ways that prohibit originality and creative thinking and action.</li>
        <li>Education conditions the mind towards entrenched ways of thinking or merely answering questions with little emphasis on understanding the questions themselves, or questioning the assumptions in the questions. Through this repeated pattern, the sense of discovery also withers. We see this as a danger, where people are tied to known patterns and unwilling to see each problem with fresh eyes.</li>
        <li>To solve issues arising from the struggle of fitting into patterns, new methods and techniques are introduced which aim to address the issue in isolation (e.g., social emotional learning, academic learning, mindfulness, etc.). This may seem like a solution but it perpetuates the accumulation of more patterns and further fragmentation.</li>
        <li>The persistent emphasis on goals, outcomes, destinations, and what should be creates linear (point A to B) and narrow pathways of learning, leaving unchallenged deeply held notions of improvement, comparison, and measurement. This projection takes us away from facing, understanding, and transforming what is actually taking place.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Transformative Education Centre explores and addresses these issues.</p>

      <h3>Bay Area Learning Centre:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Micro school environment:</strong> homeschool/school/unschool for children (learner educators) and adults (educator learners). The root meaning of ‘school’ originates from leisure. Generating a real-learning world rather than real-world learning and application. Exploring both the ‘outer world’ and the ‘world within’ and their relationship and interaction. Inter and transdisciplinary curriculum drawing on questions and themes.
        </li>
        <li>
          The intentions of the Micro school are consonant with the Intentions of a Krishnamurti School (J. Krishnamurti) &amp; An Experiment In Learning (David Bohm). See also Video Clips of Rishi Valley School RIVER (School-in-a-box) MGML (Multi-Age and Multi-Level) with K narration.

      <h4>Curriculum areas:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Inter and cross disciplinary explorations in various areas of inquiry</li>
        <li>Tinkering and maker spaces</li>

        <li><strong>Adult Education:</strong> inquiry, dialogues, conferences, workshops, retreats etc. Activities such as tinkering/maker space, music, dance, theatre, crafts, science labs, yoga, retreats, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Resource and research centre:</strong> with books and other resources.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Key questions:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>What does it look like for learning rather than the measurement of learning to be at the heart of an educational center?</li>
          <li>Rather than squeezing learning into the rigid structures of a ‘school’, what does it look like for a learning environment to pliably reflect the whole movement of learning and life?</li>
          <li>What kinds of learning experiences lend themselves to people of different ages, experiences, and fluencies to be learning all together, learning in groups, and learning independently – what is the basis for such organization and structures?</li>
          <li>When teaching, learning, curriculum, schools, and universities are so resolutely structured to demonstrate what we already know, ‘not knowing’ is a rare but crucial point of departure for education.</li>
        </ul>
